                        <p>
                          Developed at CalHacks 2019, Choices is an Android and iOS app which recommends menu items for the user to try at a restaurant based on a calulcated inference of their taste pallete and popular items for the restaurant gathered from Yelp and Google Reviews.
                          <br /><br />
                          As the project manager, I distributed roles to the rest of my team members and made sure the project was coming along cohesively. I was also responsible for developing the front-end of the app in React Native and gathering the necessary user data to the recommendation algorithm and the menu scanning algorithm in Python. I used a simple web scraper to gather the Yelp review data and used the Google Cloud Platform to gather Google Reviews data from the user's location. Then I used Google NLP's Sentiment Analysis API to gather if the user liked the item or not. Lastly, I handled the publishing of the Flask server to a Google App Engine instance primarily to improve the well-known shortcomings of the development Flask server.

                        <p>
                          Winning the "Best Financial Hack" at HackRice9, CloseCash is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.JS) web application optimized for mobile platforms allowing a user hat need close cash to match with tellers that are ranked in a list based on location and amount of cash on hand. The application consists of a receiver and teller interface, your most recent transaction, and a ranked search for the closest teller.
                          <br><br>
                          I worked on the back-end and data integration. Working with the APIs and the MongoDB database was tough especially since it was my first time with this stack, but I got it done and learned a lot. I utilized Capital One's API to create and use customer ids to make transactions in the application. Additionally, I implemented the Google Maps API to find a user's location for a searching and ranking algorithm. Lastly, we made heavy use of Passport.js, Sessions, Cookies, and Axios to secure user data and communicate between multiple servers.

                        <p>
                          In this project, which I did for my Computer Science UIL region in high school, I built a local web tool to handle local computer science contests. The tool we previously had was hard to set up,  judge with, and count points and I was approached by many other schools asking me to let them use my project in their contest.
                          <br/><br/>
                          To make the tool secure, I learned how to make prepared statements with PHP and MySQL so that the data couldn't be compromised and properly handle authentication.  In order to get the Java files that students submitted to compile securely, I had to learn how to take advantage of shell execute methods with PHP. In the future, I will be looking to revamp this whole project in Node.JS to take advantage of its vast open-source tooling and use a front-end framework in order to lessen styling headaches

                        <h3>Flappy Bird 2.0</h3>
                        <p>
                          I used Java to create this really fun desktop GUI application in which a bird tries to fly through pipes. This is similar to the original game except I revamped this to an alien/space theme. There are two modes to this game: FreePlay and Campaign. In the FreePlay mode, the player is just trying to get a high score with a UFO shooting at him. The Campaign mode is similar except after you get past 20 pipes, the boss alien comes down and tries to kill you in shooter combat.
                          <br /> <br />
                          Creating the Boss and UFO AI was the hardest part of the project. By predicting user actions and responding appropriately, I was able to code a difficult AI which is hard to beat. Everything was custom drawn with JPanel so drawing the pipes and the characters was also a bit of a challenge.
                          <br /><br />

                          <br /><br />
                          Project Now is an upcoming website that allows young student developers to find projects that they might
                          like to do for practice. Someone posts a project with appropriate technical specifications and then student developers upvote the project submits their final solution. The project poster can either accept/deny the proposed solution and even comment on it to start a conversation. There would be some monetary reward correlated to the number of upvotes a post gets to incentivice people to post projects on the site.

                          This project was a 4x4x4 Tic Tac Toe simulation with 2 AIs playing against each other. My role in the project was to develop one of the two AIs that were playing against one another.

                        <p>
                          IGN Code Foo 9 was a challenge that IGN put out to find interns for their 2019 summer recruiting season (https://www.ign.com/code-foo/2019). I was 17 at the time so I couldn't participate but I did some of the projects jut for fun anyways. I completed the witcher challenge (an algorithm challenge) using Java, the front-end challenge (replicating IGN's website) with simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript and the back-end challenge (replicating IGN's database schema and plugging in the CSV data) with MySQL.

                            Steel Scout was a mobile application that was used in my FRC team 5427 to scout teams in competitions. This improves upon our previous method of scouting (Google Forms) because it provides in-built data analytics and a pick list.
                            <br /><br />
                            As a project manager, I assigned roles to everyone in the team and created spec sheets. I made a design doc and decided upon the software stack for this project. The front-end was React Native to provide cross-platform functionality and the backend was Firebase. One of the challenges in this app was getting React Native to integrate with Firebase efficiently because the react-native-firebase library was really buggy at first.

Since high school, I have retired BitsNBytes to focus on other endeavours, but this website was an intense project that fiercly developed my backend skills. <br /><br />Using PHP and MySQL, students were able to sign up for the course, submit their homework, have it autograded, check their grades, take quizzes and tests, view curriculum and even play a make-shift JavaScript Flappy Bird game!

                            My role was to develop the backend features of the application using PHP and MySQL. This was my first full-scale application so I learned a lot about how to make a website and important fundamentals about how data is stored and collected.
